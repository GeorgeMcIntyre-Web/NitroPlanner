### üìù Tooling & Fixture Design Checklist

In NitroPlanner, the following checklist is modeled as a structured set of work units and quality gates for each tooling/fixture digital twin. Each item can be assigned to a responsible designer, tracked for completion, and validated at the appropriate workflow stage (first stage, second stage, simulation, manufacturing, etc.). This ensures all requirements are met before tooling is released for manufacturing or simulation.

39. Has the Tooling been approved in Simulation?

**Workflow Integration:**
- Each checklist item is a sub-task or quality gate in NitroPlanner.
- Items are assigned to responsible digital twins (e.g., designer, checker, simulation engineer).
- Progress is tracked in real time; items must be completed before advancing to the next workflow phase.
- Quality gates ensure no tooling is released without full validation.
- Documentation (e.g., FIDES attributes, pin verification sheets) can be attached to the relevant work unit.

### üîÑ Dynamic Change Management in 2nd Stage Design & Manufacturing

In real-world manufacturing, 2nd stage models and tooling designs are rarely static. Changes are frequently introduced‚Äîeither by the customer (new requirements, corrections, optimizations) or internally (manufacturing feedback, process improvements, lessons learned). NitroPlanner is designed to support this dynamic, iterative process, ensuring all changes are tracked, validated, and quality-assured before release to manufacturing or simulation.

#### **How NitroPlanner Supports Dynamic Change Management:**

1. **Change Request Work Units**
   - Every change (customer or internal) is logged as a work unit, linked to the affected digital twin (tooling, fixture, gripper, etc.).
   - Each change includes: description, origin (customer/internal), priority, impact assessment, responsible party, and status tracking (open, in progress, validated, closed).

2. **Revision Control & Traceability**
   - Each digital twin maintains a revision history, with all changes versioned and linked to affected checklist items or quality gates.
   - Documentation and validation results are attached to each revision for full traceability.

3. **Dynamic Quality Gates**
   - Quality gates are re-triggered for any affected checklist items when a change is made.
   - NitroPlanner prevents progression to manufacturing or simulation until all re-validated gates are passed.

4. **Real-Time Notifications & Collaboration**
   - Stakeholders are notified of changes, required actions, and status updates.
   - Comments, attachments, and discussions are logged per change.

5. **Manufacturing Feedback Loop**
   - Manufacturing engineers can initiate change requests directly in NitroPlanner.
   - Feedback is visible to design, simulation, and project management teams, ensuring a closed-loop process.

---

#### **Worked Example: Change Management in Action**

1. **Customer requests a change** to ST020_1 Tooling (e.g., new clamping point).
2. **Change work unit** is created and assigned to Lisa Rodriguez (designer).
3. Lisa updates the 2nd stage model, attaches new CAD files, and marks the change as ready for review.
4. **Quality gates** for clamping, interference, and manufacturability are re-triggered.
5. Simulation and manufacturing engineers review and validate the change.
6. Once all checks pass, the change is closed, and the digital twin revision is updated.
7. **Manufacturing proceeds** with the latest, validated design.

This approach ensures that NitroPlanner remains a living, dynamic system‚Äîcapable of handling the realities of iterative design and manufacturing, while maintaining full traceability, quality, and collaboration across all stakeholders.

### üóÇÔ∏è Machine Operation (MO) Integration: From Excel to NitroPlanner

In real-world projects, machine operation (MO) data‚Äîincluding sequence tables, interlock matrices, revision sheets, and general arrangement (GA) overviews‚Äîare often managed in Excel. NitroPlanner brings these artifacts into a structured, collaborative, and traceable digital twin environment.

#### **How MO Data Is Modeled in NitroPlanner:**

1. **MO Sequence Table**
   - Each action/step (e.g., clamp open/close, transfer position) is a work unit or checklist item linked to the relevant fixture, tooling, or station digital twin.
   - Valve assignments, mechanical functions, and home positions are attributes or sub-tasks.
   - The sequence is validated collaboratively by industrial engineers, designers, and simulation engineers.

2. **Interlock Matrix**
   - Interlocks between actions and valves are modeled as dependencies or gating conditions in the workflow.
   - Visual dashboards or tables replicate the Excel matrix, but with live, up-to-date data.

3. **Revision Sheet**
   - Every change to the MO, sequence, or hardware is logged as a versioned change request or work unit.
   - Revision history includes date, author, description, and affected digital twins.

4. **General Arrangement (GA) Overview**
   - GA drawings and part IDs are attached to the relevant digital twin.
   - Each part/component is cross-referenced with its MO/BOM entry for full traceability.

---

#### **Worked Example: Putdown Stand & Fixture MO Integration**

**Putdown Stand (e.g., ST015):**
- Digital twin includes:
  - Part-in-place proxy status
  - Associated sensors (e.g., part presence sensor)
  - Any actuators (if present)
- MO table is a checklist:

| Item     | Dia, Deg/Stroke | Monitoring | Specification           | Key Identifier | Manufacturer |
|----------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 101-PK51 | (proxy only)    | N/A        | N/A                     | N/A            | N/A          |

**Fixture with Actuators:**
- Each actuator (cylinder, clamp) is a checklist item:

| Item   | Dia, Deg/Stroke | Monitoring | Specification         | Key Identifier | Manufacturer |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 102-C1 | √ò50, 90¬∞        | Internal   | VU 50.1 BR2 A05 T12   | 2.1            | Tuenkers     |
| 105-C1 | √ò57, 50mm       | Internal   | LSA-73-L-G-50-SEN-TRK | 1              | Zaytran      |

- Interlock matrix is modeled as workflow dependencies:
  - E.g., "Clamp must be open before transfer position is reached."
- Revision sheet is logged as versioned changes:
  - E.g., "Clamp 102-C1 removed, 242-C1 added, 1057 > 110."

**General Arrangement (GA):**
- GA drawing is attached to the digital twin.
- Each part/component in the GA is linked to its MO/BOM entry.

---

**Benefits:**
- Centralizes all MO, interlock, and revision data in one system.
- Ensures traceability and quality gate enforcement for every change.
- Enables real-time collaboration and validation across engineering disciplines.
- Provides live dashboards and tables for sequence, interlocks, and revision history.

This integration transforms static Excel artifacts into dynamic, actionable, and auditable project data within NitroPlanner.

### How This Works in NitroPlanner
- Each simulation deliverable is a work unit with a checklist of sub-tasks.
- Progress is tracked visually (e.g., donut charts) and by digital twin status.
- Quality gates prevent moving to the next phase until all checks are complete.
- Documentation, videos, and reports are attached to the work unit.
- "Final Deliverables Completion" is marked when all items are checked and approved.

This simulation workflow can be expanded and customized for future projects, ensuring all simulation deliverables are managed, validated, and tracked in a structured, auditable way.
