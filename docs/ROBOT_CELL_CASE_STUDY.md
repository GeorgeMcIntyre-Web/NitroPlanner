### 📝 Tooling & Fixture Design Checklist

In NitroPlanner, the following checklist is modeled as a structured set of work units and quality gates for each **custom tooling/fixture digital twin**.

19. Have Datum Holes been added to the Base/Frame to customer specifications?
20. Have all required holes been shown, and do holes in mating parts correspond and are correctly identified? (e.g., M6 & Ø7 clearance; Clearance holes / Threaded holes; Dowel hole / Dowel hole)
21. Are all parts shimmed correctly to customer specifications?
22. Are all models (e.g., Mylars, L-blocks, machine faces, plates, etc.) designed to round figures (e.g., NOT 22.234mm)?
23. Have all Location Pin Sizes Been verified to Customer Specification & recorded in the Pin Verification Sheet?
24. Have Item Sub-Assemblies supporting Location Pins been designed to ensure a rigid structure for Positional Accuracy (avoid weak fastening configurations)?
25. Have Finite Element Analysis (FEA) been performed and do results fall within acceptable limits on large and heavy fabrications (Grippers & Steel structures)?
26. Do Cylinder & Clamp applications conform to OEM Specifications (Clamping forces)?
27. Have the required Clamp Arm Payload Calculations been done?
28. Have all open angles been verified and designated in the model?
29. Have all cylinder strokes been verified and designated in the model (5mm at end of stroke not to be used)?
30. Are part sensors, sensors for slide / dump units included – (or to customer specification, if required)?
31. Have all sensor parameters been reviewed & approved (sensing range, angles, etc.)?
32. Have Shock absorbers been calculated and included in design?
33. Are there covers for vulnerable/moving parts (e.g., linear slides, sensors...)?
34. Are there stops where applicable – (to customer specification)?
35. Have Manufacturing Processes been considered (ease of machining, assembly, etc.)?
36. Have Maintenance requirements been considered (access to lube points, removal of guards, access to cylinder flow adjust, etc.)?
37. Is there "Space Protection" for the required Controls Equipment (e.g., valve banks, trunking, piping)?
38. Have Gripper load calculations been done PRIOR TO SIMULATION (e.g., total weights & moments of inertia, etc.)?
39. Has the Tooling been approved in Simulation?

**Workflow Integration:**
- Each checklist item is a sub-task or quality gate in NitroPlanner.
- Items are assigned to responsible digital twins (e.g., designer, checker, simulation engineer).
- Progress is tracked in real time; items must be completed before advancing to the next workflow phase.
- Quality gates ensure no tooling is released without full validation.
- Documentation (e.g., FIDES attributes, pin verification sheets) can be attached to the relevant work unit.

### 🔄 Dynamic Change Management in 2nd Stage Design & Manufacturing

In real-world manufacturing, 2nd stage models and tooling designs are rarely static. Changes are frequently introduced—either by the customer (new requirements, corrections, optimizations) or internally (manufacturing feedback, process improvements, lessons learned). NitroPlanner is designed to support this dynamic, iterative process, ensuring all changes are tracked, validated, and quality-assured before release to manufacturing or simulation.

#### **How NitroPlanner Supports Dynamic Change Management:**

1. **Change Request Work Units**
   - Every change (customer or internal) is logged as a work unit, linked to the affected digital twin (tooling, fixture, gripper, etc.).
   - Each change includes: description, origin (customer/internal), priority, impact assessment, responsible party, and status tracking (open, in progress, validated, closed).

2. **Revision Control & Traceability**
   - Each digital twin maintains a revision history, with all changes versioned and linked to affected checklist items or quality gates.
   - Documentation and validation results are attached to each revision for full traceability.

3. **Dynamic Quality Gates**
   - Quality gates are re-triggered for any affected checklist items when a change is made.
   - NitroPlanner prevents progression to manufacturing or simulation until all re-validated gates are passed.

4. **Real-Time Notifications & Collaboration**
   - Stakeholders are notified of changes, required actions, and status updates.
   - Comments, attachments, and discussions are logged per change.

5. **Manufacturing Feedback Loop**
   - Manufacturing engineers can initiate change requests directly in NitroPlanner.
   - Feedback is visible to design, simulation, and project management teams, ensuring a closed-loop process.

---

#### **Worked Example: Change Management in Action**

1. **Customer requests a change** to ST020_1 Tooling (e.g., new clamping point).
2. **Change work unit** is created and assigned to Lisa Rodriguez (designer).
3. Lisa updates the 2nd stage model, attaches new CAD files, and marks the change as ready for review.
4. **Quality gates** for clamping, interference, and manufacturability are re-triggered.
5. Simulation and manufacturing engineers review and validate the change.
6. Once all checks pass, the change is closed, and the digital twin revision is updated.
7. **Manufacturing proceeds** with the latest, validated design.

This approach ensures that NitroPlanner remains a living, dynamic system—capable of handling the realities of iterative design and manufacturing, while maintaining full traceability, quality, and collaboration across all stakeholders.

### 🗂️ Machine Operation (MO) Integration: From Excel to NitroPlanner

In real-world projects, machine operation (MO) data—including sequence tables, interlock matrices, revision sheets, and general arrangement (GA) overviews—are often managed in Excel. NitroPlanner brings these artifacts into a structured, collaborative, and traceable digital twin environment.

#### **How MO Data Is Modeled in NitroPlanner:**

1. **MO Sequence Table**
   - Each action/step (e.g., clamp open/close, transfer position) is a work unit or checklist item linked to the relevant fixture, tooling, or station digital twin.
   - Valve assignments, mechanical functions, and home positions are attributes or sub-tasks.
   - The sequence is validated collaboratively by industrial engineers, designers, and simulation engineers.

2. **Interlock Matrix**
   - Interlocks between actions and valves are modeled as dependencies or gating conditions in the workflow.
   - Visual dashboards or tables replicate the Excel matrix, but with live, up-to-date data.

3. **Revision Sheet**
   - Every change to the MO, sequence, or hardware is logged as a versioned change request or work unit.
   - Revision history includes date, author, description, and affected digital twins.

4. **General Arrangement (GA) Overview**
   - GA drawings and part IDs are attached to the relevant digital twin.
   - Each part/component is cross-referenced with its MO/BOM entry for full traceability.

---

#### **Worked Example: Putdown Stand & Fixture MO Integration**

**Putdown Stand (e.g., ST015):**
- Digital twin includes:
  - Part-in-place proxy status (Unit 101-PK51)
  - Associated sensors (e.g., part presence sensor - Unit 301-S1)
  - Any actuators (if present - Unit 401-A1, etc.)
- MO table is a checklist of individual units:

| Unit Number | Dia, Deg/Stroke | Monitoring | Specification           | Key Identifier | Manufacturer |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|-------------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 101-PK51    | (proxy only)    | N/A        | N/A                     | N/A            | N/A          |

**Fixture with Actuators:**
- Each unit (cylinder, clamp, slide, sensor) is a checklist item:

| Unit Number | Dia, Deg/Stroke | Actuation Method | Monitoring | Specification         | Key Identifier | Manufacturer |

- Interlock matrix is modeled as workflow dependencies:
  - E.g., "Clamp must be open before transfer position is reached."
- Revision sheet is logged as versioned changes:
  - E.g., "Clamp 102-C1 removed, 242-C1 added, 1057 > 110."

**General Arrangement (GA):**
- GA drawing is attached to the digital twin.
- Each part/component in the GA is linked to its MO/BOM entry.

---

**Benefits:**
- Centralizes all MO, interlock, and revision data in one system.
- Ensures traceability and quality gate enforcement for every change.
- Enables real-time collaboration and validation across engineering disciplines.
- Provides live dashboards and tables for sequence, interlocks, and revision history.

This integration transforms static Excel artifacts into dynamic, actionable, and auditable project data within NitroPlanner.
