- **And any other industry** - The platform is now truly universal

### **Key Changes Made:**
- Removed all automotive-specific references from UI, documentation, and seed data
- Updated industry options to include technology, healthcare, energy, construction, etc.
- Changed example projects from automotive-specific to generic manufacturing examples
- Updated company names and descriptions to be industry-neutral
- Made CAD software descriptions and templates generic
- Expanded industry validation to support broader range of sectors

This transformation ensures that the Human Digital Twin System can be deployed across any industry while maintaining all its advanced capabilities for intelligent resource management.
